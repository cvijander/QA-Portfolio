# Improvement Suggestion: Add a "Wishlist" Feature

- **Feature Area:** Product Page & User Account
- **Priority:** Medium

---

### 1. The Problem / Opportunity

Currently, users Browse the "Cosmetic Shop" website can either add a product to their cart or leave the page. There is no option to save a product they are interested in but not ready to buy immediately. This can lead to users forgetting about the product and a potential loss of sales.

### 2. Proposed Solution

I suggest implementing a "Wishlist" feature.

- **On the Product Page:** Add a "heart" icon or an "Add to Wishlist" button next to the "Add to Cart" button.
- **In the User Account:** Create a new "My Wishlist" section where all saved products are displayed in a list.
- **Functionality:** From the wishlist, users should be able to directly move an item to their cart or remove it from the list.

### 3. Benefits

- **For the User:** Allows users to save and track products they are interested in, improving their shopping experience and organization.
- **For the Business:**
    - Increases user engagement and encourages return visits.
    - Can reduce cart abandonment.
    - Provides valuable data on which products are most popular, even if not immediately purchased.
